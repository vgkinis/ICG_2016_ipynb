    "The transformation of snow to firn and eventually ice is one of the most important processes in ice core glaciology. A \"mixed blessing\" as Christo Buizert has once called it, it gives us challenges when we try to interpret ice core records but also provides us with many paleoclimatic tools to study past climate. We will deal with densification of snow at a dry snow zone, descibe the boundary conditions of the problem and derive a simple semi-empirical model for the process of densification based on the paper by Herron and Langway. The goal of this module is to understand the parameters at play in the densification of snow, get familiar with important definitions often used in ice core science, build matlab/python code that impliments the Herron and Langway densification model and finally apply it on several ice core data sets frm Greenland and Antarctica.
